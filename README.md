# SandboxWeb

This repository serves as a personal sandbox for exploring and experimenting with web development technologies, specifically HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript. It's a place to try out new techniques, test different approaches, and generally play around with front-end web development.

## Purpose

The primary goals of this sandbox are:

*   **Learning:** To deepen my understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript by actively using and experimenting with them.
*   **Prototyping:** To quickly prototype and test web development ideas before incorporating them into larger projects.
*   **Exploration:** To explore new libraries, frameworks, and techniques within the front-end web development ecosystem.

## Contents

The repository is organized into directories, each focusing on a specific area of exploration. Examples include:

*   **`html-css`:** Experiments with HTML structure and CSS styling.
*   **`javascript`:** JavaScript code snippets and experiments.
*   **`animations`:** CSS and JavaScript animations.
*   **`responsive`:** Responsive design experiments.
*   **`frameworks` (Optional):**  If you use a framework like React, Vue, or Angular for some experiments, you could add this directory.
